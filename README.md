# Cartographer

Cartographer is a javascript module for [Wee](https://github.com/weepower/wee)
that makes creating and managing web maps easier. It uses Leaflet 0.7.7 and
Mapbox. The intent of this module is to make web maps easier & faster to
implement on client sites, while taking advantage of Wee's JS capabilities.

## Feature Roadmap

Cartographer has most of the features you'll be looking for when creating maps.
Centering on coordinates, setting zoom levels, and adding features are all
possible in Cartographer. If you encounter a situation where you're lacking
a feature, open an issue in this repo and let's talk about it. If it's a good
idea, I'll build it into Cartographer for the next release.
